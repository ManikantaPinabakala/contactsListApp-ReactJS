- In this application, we will create a contact list and we will also add the
  following functionalities to the application

  - Adding a new contact to the list (Adding New Item to the List in State)
  - Updating the Favorite icon (Updating an Item of the List in State)

- We will also understand what's **UUID** and how to use it to create and assign
  a universally unique id to a React list element.
